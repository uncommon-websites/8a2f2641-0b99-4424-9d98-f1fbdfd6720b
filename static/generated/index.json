    "prompt": "A confident elementary teacher stands in a bright, sunlit classroom, smiling warmly. The environment features soft natural morning light, cozy wood textures, and organized learning materials in calming blues and warm neutrals. The teacher is positioned off-center, with layered depth created by foreground classroom objects like books or plants, and softly blurred background activity of students engaged in learning. The overall mood is optimistic and calm, emphasizing professional fulfillment and the supportive, harmonious atmosphere of the classroom. No tech, no screens, no text, only authentic human connection and a sense of spaciousness.",
